I, Jarrod Pooler, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be a pomodoro timer in ruby. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.

I've got a few timers I use, but need to figure out one that integrates well with the command line and doesn't require the bell.
