## simple_pomo

After figuring out the default for the repo I was using is to autostart incomplete tasks, I decided to just roll my own since I don't realy need most of what was done. Perhaps later on I'll revisit, but for now I'm going to KISS. 

Starting with a blank slate can be fun, but not without examples to borrow.

Pomodoro has a few main components I'll need to code up:

1. Operational
	a. Start Timer (25m)
    b. Stop Timer
    c. Pause Timer
    d. Break Timer (5m)
2. Notify via notification center
	a. Clear notification after X seconds (5)
3. Bonus: Track number of completed Pomo's TODAY
	a. Always default to zero? 
    b. Perhaps track over time and graph?
    
    
[Initial Commit](https://github.com/jpooler/simple_pomo) currently just creates a notification window from the command line. Based on my research, will need to move from terminal-notifier to using [alerter2.0](https://github.com/vjeantet/alerter) in the next session.
